			Mitsuki Laycock, more mononymlous known as Mitski, is a Japanese-American singer-songwriter. She was born on September 27, 1990 to an  American father and Japanese mother. As she was growing up, she was also moving from country to country on a constant basis due to her father's career. At a young age, she also started exploring and studying music. She first decided to pursue film, before changing to studio composition. She studied studio composition at the State University of New York at Purchase, where she recorded and self-released her first two albums, Lush and Retired from Sad, New Career in Business, which served as her school projects. During her time as SUNY, she also met Patrick Hyland, who will help her in producing all of her albums after Lush. 
			<br>
			Her music is known for the depth of the emotions seen in the lyrics and instrumental. It is also known for blending in lots of different genres. Many find her lyrics as "relatable" as Mitski said that her music can serve as a place where people "can put all of their feelings, their ugliness, that doesnâ€™t have a place in their own lives."In 2021, she announced that she will be taking a hiatus from music in order for her to focus on herself, her mental and emotional health.
